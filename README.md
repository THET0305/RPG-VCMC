# RPG-VCMC
I am developing a web app to give remote and on-site hybrid TTRPG gaming sessions a good way to connect both types of players. This is to support my pathfinder RPG that has 2 players that have moved away but still want to play.

## Planned Features
- VC: Video chat with audio echo cancelation.
- AC: Audio contol for the GM to sync remote player music with onsite music.
- PDC: Player Dice Camera viewable by GM only for remote players. This is to give the GM visibility on the remote players rolls to ensure fair gameplay and player trust.
- GCVL: GM Controlled Video Layout allowing the GM to arrange the video layout for the display showing the remote players to the onsite players.

## Current Features
None

### Tech Stack
- Firebase: Database for session tracking, authenticaion, etc.
- Firebase CLI: TBA
- Node.js: TBA
- VS Code:
- Git: Version control.
